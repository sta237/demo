```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) # sets the chunk option globally
```

```{r example, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Inline Code

The inline code `r round(pi, 4)` renders 3.1416.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3, out.width=".5\\linewidth", fig.cap="Figure Caption", fig.align="center"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Table

Use `kable` to create well-formatted tables with captions.

```{r sometable}
library(knitr) 
# if you have already loaded the  library 
# in a previous chunk, there is no need 
# to load it again here.
tbl <- data.frame(
  Labels = c('Label 1', 'Label 2', 'Label 3'),
  Numbers = c(1000,200,-35),
  Decimals = c(1.0005, pi, exp(1))
)
kable(tbl, 
      format='latex', # tell kable the table is 
                      # for a PDF document
      # you need to include "\usepackage{booktabs}" 
      # in the YAML under "header-includes"
      booktabs=TRUE, # better looking table
      caption='Caption for table', # caption
      digits=2) # number of digits
```
